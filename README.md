# Pokedex CLI

A fully functional command-line Pokedex built in Go.  
It uses the PokeAPI to let users explore location areas, catch PokÃ©mon, and inspect their stats.

## Features

- `help` â€” Show available commands
- `map` / `mapb` â€” Navigate through PokÃ©mon locations
- `explore <location>` â€” Show all PokÃ©mon in a location
- `catch <pokemon>` â€” Try to catch a PokÃ©mon
- `inspect <pokemon>` â€” View stats of a caught PokÃ©mon
- In-memory caching for faster repeated API requests

## Run It

```bash
go run .

### ðŸš€ Want to Go Further?

If you want to keep building, try:
- Adding a battle simulation (`battle pikachu vs charmander`)
- Saving caught PokÃ©mon to a file (so progress is saved)
- Auto-suggestions or tab-completion for commands

Let me know if you want help adding any features or making a portfolio-worthy README!
